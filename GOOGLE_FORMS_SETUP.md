## Step 2: Get the Form URLs

### Method 1: Get Embed URL
1. Click "Send" button in your form
2. Click the "Embed" tab (< > icon)
3. Copy the URL from the iframe src attribute
4. Example: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd.../viewform?embedded=true`

### Method 2: Get Direct URL
1. Click "Send" button in your form  
2. Click the "Link" tab (ðŸ”— icon)
3. Copy the shortened URL
4. Example: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd.../viewform`

## Step 3: Update Your Website

Replace the placeholder URLs in these files:

### File: `/src/app/forms/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Line ~15 - Update vendor application URLs
googleFormUrl: 'YOUR_DIRECT_FORM_URL_HERE',
embedUrl: 'YOUR_EMBED_FORM_URL_HERE',
```

### File: `/src/app/forms/[slug]/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Line ~15 - Update vendor application URLs
embedUrl: 'YOUR_EMBED_FORM_URL_HERE',
googleFormUrl: 'YOUR_DIRECT_FORM_URL_HERE',
```

## Step 4: View Form Responses

1. **In Google Forms**: Click "Responses" tab to view submissions
2. **Export to Sheets**: Click the Google Sheets icon to create a spreadsheet
3. **Get Notifications**: Go to form settings and enable email notifications

## Adding More Forms

To add additional forms (feedback, rentals, etc.):

1. Create the new Google Form
2. Get the URLs as described above
3. Add a new entry to the `formData` object in both files:

```typescript
'new-form-slug': {
  title: 'Your Form Title',
  description: 'Form description',
  embedUrl: 'YOUR_EMBED_URL',
  googleFormUrl: 'YOUR_DIRECT_URL',
  deadline: '2025-08-01', // or null
  instructions: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],
  requirements: ['Requirement 1', 'Requirement 2'] // or null
}
```

4. Add the form to the `availableForms` array in `/src/app/forms/page.tsx`

## Form Settings Recommendations

### Security Settings:
- âœ… Limit to 1 response per person (if needed)
- âœ… Require sign-in (optional, for accountability)
- âœ… Enable email notifications for new responses

### Response Settings:
- âœ… Show confirmation message after submission
- âœ… Enable response editing (if appropriate)
- âœ… Send respondent a copy of their response

### Advanced Settings:
- âœ… Set response deadline (if needed)
- âœ… Close form automatically when deadline reached
- âœ… Customize confirmation message

## Sample Confirmation Message:

"Jazakallahu Khayran! Your vendor application has been received. We will review your submission and contact you within 3-5 business days. If you have any questions, please contact us at info@masqueens.org or (718) 606-6025."

## Monitoring and Management

### Weekly Tasks:
- Check for new form responses
- Respond to applications within promised timeframe
- Update form status (open/closed) as needed

### Before Events:
- Set application deadlines
- Close forms when capacity reached
- Send confirmation emails to selected vendors

## Troubleshooting

**Form not displaying?**
- Check that the embed URL is correct
- Ensure the form is set to "public" or "anyone with link"
- Try the direct URL instead

**Styling issues?**
- Google Forms inherit some styles from the parent page
- The iframe height can be adjusted in the code
- Forms are responsive by default

## Future Enhancements

This Google Forms integration is the foundation. Future improvements could include:
- Custom form builder in admin panel
- Automatic response processing
- Integration with your user database
- Payment processing for paid applications
- Advanced approval workflows

For now, this gives you immediate capability to collect vendor applications and other form submissions professionally!
